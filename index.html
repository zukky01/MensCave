        <p> Despite knowing exercise is good for you, it's easy to tell convince yourself you'll get to it when you have spare or free time. 
            The real issue is, you never seem to have less to do or extra time. Health problems and a little extra weight prompting up may not be enough to scare you into exercising regularly.
            But have you really think about the great benefits you'll gain from exercising.
            Exercise benefits for men
            Want to know the benefits of exercising regularly? Just about any physician will tell you exercise will improve your life and your health. Here are just a few benefits men can gain through exercise:</br>
           <p>
            •   Longer life expectancy<br>
            •	Lower risk of diabetes<br>
            •	Lower cholesterol<br>
            •	Reduced depression and anxiety</br>
            •	Lower risk of high blood pressure<br>
            •	Healthier blood vessels<br>
            •	Weight loss<br>
            •	Improved testosterone levels as you age<br>
            •	Lower risk of colon cancer<br>
            •	Stronger bones<br>
            •	Reduced risk of erectile dysfunction</p>
            
            <p>How often should I exercise?
            Knowing the benefits of regular exercise is great. But you might be tempted to think you have to exercise for hours on end to reap any benefit. Fortunately, that's not the case. Walking or for just half an hour a day can help reduce your risk for many health problems, including diabetes and cancer. Even better, add 30 minutes of strength training 2-3 days a week. Although it might seem like a lot at first, carving out that half-hour of time shouldn't be too difficult. The more time and energy you put into it, the more likely you and your health will benefit.
            Better Quality of life
            Regular exercise will lead to a better quality of life. Regular exercise helps you with our mental health state - it eases the depression, anxiety, and anger that come up in everyday life. Having tension from a long day of work? Exercise can help relieve it. A brief 30-minute session of moderate exercise can also boost your energy levels, help you sleep better, and improve your self-image.
            Whether you're 25 or 55, exercise is important. Carving out 30 minutes each day to invest in your future health is well worth it and easier than you think. Most often, the hardest part is starting. Once you take that first step and form a habit, it's smooth sailing.
            So do yourself a favor and take the step!</p>
